## Sam's Friday

    It's 12 o'clock, Friday, Sam's boss wants Sam to give him report in 3 pm, Sam also wants to write another report and then check emails. He doesn't really know how much time would he spend on emails

So what he does:

* takes a lunch — it is 1 pm
* checks emails
* Finds a message about next Wednesdey meeting
* Looks up numbers for that meeting
* Tries to correct them
* Boss calls — it is 4 pm, Sam hasn't started his report yet

Sam worked really hard, but was unproductive

*That's why Sam didn't have a plan*

So Sam's new plan is:

* 1 to 3 pm: complete a report
* 3:15 to 3:45: complete second report
* 4 to 4:45 check emails

If Boss calls and tells Sam second report is burning, Sam may reorder or stay as it is, knowing when exactly second report would come in the both scenarios
